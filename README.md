A Stand alone Radio for Steel Beast Pro PE

This is a fork of SRS (simple radio standalone) for Steel Beasts https://github.com/BlueF16/SRS-SteelBeast

I am currently evaluating the project to determine if it meets our requirements. Later, we plan to clean up the project, make modifications to the client, and add an installer.

**There is currently no release available!** If you would like to test it yourself, please use the SRS for Steel Beasts mentioned above.
